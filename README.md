# GESTURE
AI-Based Gesture Control System, This Python project uses computer vision and gesture recognition to control the computer without touching the mouse or keyboard. By combining OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, the system allows a user to interact with the computer using just eye and hand movements through a webcam.
